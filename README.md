# project-testing-practice

This is a collection of functions and tests written in order to learn TDD using JavaScript and Jest.

This includes the following:
- A `capitalize` function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
- A `reverseString` function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
- A `calculator` object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply.
- A `caesarCipher` function that takes a string and returns it with each character “shifted”.
